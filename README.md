# crowdfunding_ETL
Practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, pandas, and PostgreSQL

by Jason Estrada

The project works around the process of Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL).

### Extract

- Data was pulled from two Excel files (in Resources folder)

### Transform

- Using the Jupyter notebook file, multiple dataframes were created with pandas, and data cleaned and exported to .csv files (in Resources folder)

### Load

- QuickDBD was used to create the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the schema.
- Table schema was created in PostgreSQL and data from the .csv files were imported once created.
